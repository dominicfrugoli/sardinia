## About The Project

[Notion Project Homepage](https://fenidesign.notion.site/Sardinia-Independent-Project-24255e64caba44d3b6232d27743844be?pvs=4)

Sardinia is the codename for a sampler that is currently being built by me for an Independent Project during my senior year at Columbia College Chicago. It uses the Electrosmith Daisy platform and is an exercise for me to venture into the world of product design.

This independent project is called "The Product Design Process for Electronic Instruments" and was pitched by myself specifically to give myself experience in the process of the full production of an audio hardware device. This means starting at research, then going through every stage of production and design to end up with a final product. There is a large emphasis on the process and showing future companies that I understand somewhat what it takes.
### Built With

- [Daisy Seed](https://electro-smith.com/products/daisy-seed)
- [libDaisy](https://github.com/electro-smith/libDaisy)
- [DaisySP](https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisySP)
- [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/)
- [Fusion 360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/)
## Roadmap

##### Weeks 1-5 | Ideation and Programming

- Week 1
    - Come up with overall idea and mission statement for the instrument
    - Research DSP ideas and programming concepts needed
    - Gather ideas and inspiration from specific hardware
- Week 2 & 3
    - Start programming all DSP and hardware handling for instrument
    - Lots of iteration and testing will be needed
    - Research here is critical as well to get main audio concepts down
    - Daisy Examples will be main research source
    - Recording different iterations of the project will be great for documentation
- Week 4 & 5
    - Work on finalizing code and getting it to a point for implementation
    - Use daisy examples and others’ code to help with style guidance
    - Get friends to test out for playability and sound, as well as get ideas
    - Build a central repo for code which can be updated as needed
    - Coding doesn’t stop with this step, but it should be mostly done by now
    - Start recording breadboard schematics if time allows to make PCB design easier


#####  Weeks 6-10 | PCB and Hardware Design

- Week 6 & 7
    - Refresh KICAD skills with tutorials
    - Build out schematic for PCB in KICAD
    - Design PCB completely and order for testing in week 8 & 9
    - Case design will be important here to make sure layout works with PCB
    - Final component selection will take place here
- Week 8 & 9
    - Work on case design with cardboard PCB to test out everything
    - Decide on case material (likely 3D printed)
    - Build out specifics for case such as standoff points and strength areas
    - Allow case to have daisy in a place that is easily reprogrammed
    - Assemble and test PCBs once they arrive (make changes and reorder if necessary)
    - Finish working on design and model for case
- Week 10
    - Start putting together first prototype of instrument with printed PCB and case
    - Play with instrument musically and have others try
    - This is when a lot of testing can be done for the usability

#####  Weeks 11-15 | Manufacturing and Documentation

- Week 11
    - Finalize design of case and overall visual style of instrument
    - Work on process for assembling, as well as BOM and any other assembly materials
- Week 12 & 13
    - Work on customer documentation for instrument
    - Design manual for the user
    - Design packaging for the instrument
    - Work on advertising and marketing for it
- Week 14 & 15
    - Build final version of instrument to be shown and displayed
        - Maybe one fully complete and two hollow cases for ad campaign
    - Final write up and documentation for instrument
    - Add writeup to portfolio website
    - Present it to friends and professors
    - Any last requirements for Visda
